title: Raspberry Pi based RTL-SDR Input Level and In-Band Fluctuation Measurement Tool
---

# Overview

* 임의의 주파수 대역의 신호를 수신하여 Input Level을 측정
* In-Band Fluctuation을 판단하는 지표로써 ITU-R BT.0000에서의 정의하고 있는 Standard Deviation 값 측정


# Hardware

* [Raspberry Pi Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/)
* [Software Defined Radio Receiver USB Stick - RTL2832 w/R820T](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1497)
* [MCX Jack to SMA RF Cable Adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1532)

# Installation 



# Implementation

```python
# notation
def x
x = 0
x = 2 + 2
x = 2 + 2
x = 2 + 2
x = 2 + 2
x = 2 + 2x = 2 + 2x = 2 + 2x = 2 + 2x = 2 + 2x = 2 + 2x = 2 + 2x = 2 + 2x = 2 + 2x = 2 + 2
what is x
```



```matlab
%% notation
def x
x = 0
x = 2 + 2
what is x
```
